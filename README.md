## Project Description   

The project will allow you to solidify your proficiency in C# and ASP.NET Core. As you design your web application, you will get a practical experience of creating domain models, developing unit tests, and implementing a user interface and the presentation layer using .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. When you complete this project, you will have a working web application showpiece to include in your portfolio.

The goal of the project is to create a To Do List web application that allows users to manage their personal activities by creating to do lists. The web application should work correctly on a desktop computer and a mobile phone. You may use the domain model from the Week #10 assignment as a starting point for your design. However, this application should be more functional.

## Project Description   

The project allowed you to solidify my proficiency in C# and ASP.NET Core. As I designed my web application, I got a practical experience of creating domain models, developing unit tests, and implementing a user interface and the presentation layer using .NET Core and ASP.NET Core. 

The goal of the project is to create a To Do List web application that allows users to manage their personal activities by creating to do lists. The web application should work correctly on a web.
